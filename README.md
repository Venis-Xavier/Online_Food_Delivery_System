# Online-Food-Delivery-System

The project streamlines online food ordering by allowing customers to
browse restaurant menus, place orders, and track deliveries through an
intuitive web interface. Restaurants can manage their menus, process
incoming orders, and monitor delivery status. Built using a microservices
architecture, the system ensures scalability and maintainability. Admins
can oversee users, restaurants, and overall platform activity through a
centralized dashboard.
